"You have QQ?" The World Wide Web should be international. Single-language websites restrict the power of the Web. Google Translate helps, but requires copy-pasting. Can’t read your Facebook news feed? Want to join QQ?

Enter YouLing.
 

Mouse-over a piece of text anywhere on your computer, and it will automatically be translated to the language of your choice! Open a popup window to enter text in two languages at once.
